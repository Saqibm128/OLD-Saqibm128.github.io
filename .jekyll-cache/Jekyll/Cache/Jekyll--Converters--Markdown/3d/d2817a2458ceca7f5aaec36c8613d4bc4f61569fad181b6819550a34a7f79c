I"=<p>I’m a CS and BME grad who’s working at a software engineering startup called Patientco. I’ve had the feeling to start working on a blog for awhile now and to revamp this website as well. In particular, a mentor suggested that I try and create a blog to show my work over time and to catalog my thoughts.</p>
