I"c<p>Hi! My name is Mohammed Saqib (he/him)! I’m excited to meet y’all.</p>

<p>I’m a Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering Student at Georgia Tech who completed his undergraduate study in May 2020. I’m interested in both machine learning and highly scalable web services, as well as projects with a real impact. I am particularly interested in working in projects with an impact on the healthcare system.</p>

<p>I’ve done a few big things over time. Here are the most pertinent!</p>
<ol>
  <li>I’m currently working and enjoying time as a full-time software engineer at <a href="https://patientco.com">Patientco</a> where I get to play around with web tech stacks. I did several co-op rotations here before deciding to take a job after graduation!</li>
  <li>I did research as an undergraduate for <a href="https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/">MIBLAB</a> at Georgia Tech. I did research for both sepsis prediction and seizure detection using a variety of algorithms and worked on data pipelines.</li>
  <li>I also was a teaching assistant for a class called Object Oriented Design and Analysis (CS 2340), where I helped mentor sophomore and junior CS students to make Android apps.</li>
  <li>I did a research internship in summer 2019 as part of Harvard <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/summer-institute-biomedical-informatics">SIBMI</a>.</li>
</ol>
