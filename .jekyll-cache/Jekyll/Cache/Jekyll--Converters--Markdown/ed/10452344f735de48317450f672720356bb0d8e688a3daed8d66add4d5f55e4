I"æ<p>Iâ€™ll make this a quick update. Iâ€™ve known that fellowships in general come a few months before grad school, but it looks like the NSF GRFP is coming in October, around the 20th (seems different disciplines are staggered by a few days). I ended up working today on just making notes on the requirements for the GRFP and what were some generic tips on it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll link it here.

<p>Good night.</p>
