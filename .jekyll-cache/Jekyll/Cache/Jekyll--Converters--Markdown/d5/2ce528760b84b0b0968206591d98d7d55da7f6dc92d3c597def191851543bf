I"Í<p>Iâ€™m a CS and BME grad whoâ€™s working at a software engineering startup called Patientco. Iâ€™ve had the feeling to start working on a blog for awhile now and to revamp this website as well. In particular, a mentor suggested that I try and create a blog to show my work over time and to catalog my thoughts.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m supposed to be working on a personal statement as per my own suggested timeline for a few eventual grad school applications. However, the idea of typing out a personal statement feels a bit daunting, as it requires summarizing key aspects and accomplishments in a way that suggests that everything was thought out. In all honesty, my path through college and life hasnâ€™t had a straight trajectory to any one goal; I doubt, thinking back though, that anyone could say they had a fool-proof plan for college and life right after graduating high school, that they had the full perspective to say that.</p>

<p>The point of this blog is two-fold. 1) I want to at least start cataloguing my thoughts in a public way. I know with Jekyll I can probably change posts, but Iâ€™m gonna try to keep it read-only once I post a new page. 2) I want to make a resource others can follow. Maybe it can help others. With all honesty, Iâ€™ve been quite fortunate in my life and Iâ€™ve always believed in the idea of collaboration and helping others. If this blog would help someone else, I would be quite happy.</p>

<p>My goal, in 92 days, is to apply for grad school.</p>
