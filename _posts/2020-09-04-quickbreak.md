 In a way, this blog and the the Kanban-styled board I've set up is being used to create a sense of altered (i.e. mostly heightened) urgency to grad school applications. I mostly want to give myself tme to research and ensure I apply to a place based on my best judgement. However, I'm finding that today that I'm rather fatigued. I spent most of today, after work, playing Hollow Knight.

 I'm planning on spending an hour reading up on some random grad school stuff and taking a few notes, but I think I'll take it a bit easier today. In general, I think the key to this whole process is probably pacing, which is definitely something I need more practice in.
