I'm a CS and BME grad who's working at a software engineering startup called Patientco. I've had the feeling to start working on a blog for awhile now and to revamp this website as well. In particular, a mentor suggested that I try and create a blog to show my work over time and to catalog my thoughts.

I'm supposed to be working on a personal statement as per my own suggested timeline for a few eventual grad school applications. However, the idea of typing out a personal statement feels a bit daunting, as it requires summarizing key aspects and accomplishments in a way that suggests that everything was thought out. In all honesty, my path through college and life hasn't had a straight trajectory to any one goal; I doubt, thinking back though, that anyone could say they had a fool-proof plan for college and life right after graduating high school, that they had the full perspective to say that.

The point of this blog is two-fold. 1) I want to at least start cataloguing my thoughts in a public way. I know with Jekyll I can probably change posts, but I'm gonna try to keep it read-only once I post a new page. 2) I want to make a resource others can follow. Maybe it can help others. With all honesty, I've been quite fortunate in my life and I've always believed in the idea of collaboration and helping others. If this blog would help someone else, I would be quite happy.

*My goal, in 92 days, is to apply for grad school.*
