Honestly, the first post was a bit confusing, so allow me to reintroduce the premise of this. This is a blog detailing my process around applying for grad school. A lot of the schools I'm applying for are doing an application date of around December 1st, so I'm trying to count down the days until then. In general, I'm planning on making this an informal blog, with a stream of consciousness tone.

Today, I spent a significant amount of time finishing up some projects for work and went for an hour jog. I've had an on-off relationship with timetracking ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x28ZZcdsv1A](see this podcast)), but I ended up getting free from a lot of the stuff I do for general welfare and upkeep of myself around 9:30. Today I ended up spending about 2 hours on looking through notes my friend Yidi sent me. I've tried compiling a list of the notes I took from there and put it into a [https://www.notion.so/Grad-School-Literature-a0ed90739e6f457c8bd5f0737a94820e](Notion spreadsheet). I'm also working on a [https://www.notion.so/1f629c52461d4db78fd192f80c74a150?v=897ea0e30c20475e8652eaf38af1d0fe](calendar) of deadlines. It seems there are even more pressing deadlines like the GRFP and Hertz Fellowship, all due sometime in mid October.

I'll call it a day on this blog anyways.
