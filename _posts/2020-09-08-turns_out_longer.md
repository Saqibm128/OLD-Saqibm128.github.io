 Yeah, a quick break turned into a long break for the Memorial Day weekend. Spent most of the weekend just taking a break and playing Hollow Knight and reading. Did some work for a past research mentor for a paper based on some of the same research I was collaborating on back when I was still a student, but that part is done for now.

 I'm mostly needing to finish up a first draft of the GRFP applications really, which is a bit weird... Right now, thinking back on my undergraduate career and trying to remember all the stuff I'd done is kinda like opening the faucet. There's so much cool and awesome stuff I've gotten a chance to try out that when I spell it all out, I feel kinda happy inside thinking about how far I've come. I'm typing most of this down for a personal statement and will probably need a ton of iterations on it. I'm also thinking about the research proposal; thinking about doing that open question on EEG seizure detection that could correct for individual biases but I'm also endlessly fascinated by federated machine learning and its promise for healthcare.

 Anyways, I did update some of my goals for the grad school process. For example, I changed the goal of reading 10 different example GRFP applications to 5. I think I realized after the first 5 that due to diminishing returns I'd be unlikely to be getting much more use out of them. To be fair, I only looked at successful applications; it may actually prove instructive to look at unsuccessful applications.

 I've also seen this [https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/iofvuo/when_is_a_good_time_to_reach_out_to_prospective/](article) about reaching out to professors in August ideally. I think I may have screwed up in that I think I should be trying to reach out earlier, but I'm not entirely sure what to do exactly or how many to reach out to. I've added a new task to go ahead and make emails for those professors anyways.
